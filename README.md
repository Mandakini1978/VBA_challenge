# Mandakini Bootcamp HomeWork : The VBA of Wall Street
 
Background
 In this assignment, I  used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 
Data Source:
•  Test Data – I used this data while developing my scripts.
•  Stock Data – I ran my scripts on this data to generate the final  report.

Analysis
•   I developed a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
•	The ticker symbol.
•	Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The total stock volume of the stock.
•  I  did conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
•  My solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

Uploaded Files :
•  I have submitted screen shot for each year of  results on the Multi Year Stock Data into following files
"2014_Screenshot.jpg" , "2015_Screenshot.jpg" , "2016_Screenshot.jpg"

• I also submitted VBA scripts as separate file into following file
	
" VBA_Challenge.vbs" : This file contains two different subroutines.
 
**VBA_Challenge ()**: This function generates a summary table containg following information :
     1.The ticker symbol.
     2.Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
     3.The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
     4.The total stock volume of the stock and 
     5.conditional formatting on "Yearly Change" column that will highlight positive change 
            in   green and negative change in red.
            
**Calculate ()**: This function calculates "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" from summary table.
